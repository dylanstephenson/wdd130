                    <strong>About Me</strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ocean Son started out as my creative outlet to learn and hone my craft as a 
                    songwriter and producer. It soon became a project where me, my brother, Beau Stephenson, 
                    friend and songwriter Coral Bones, producer Carson Beck, and many others would provide 
                    their talents, ideas, and feedback. Through the process of producing my first few songs,
                    I realized that Ocean Son was much bigger than myself and my own ideas. The songs I wrote
                    became a place where other artists and producers could work together while I learned 
                    from their experience and expertise. The weeks spent on No More, Heartbeat, Falling Apart,
                    and other soon to be released singles were filled with many stupid jokes, sparks of inspiration,
                    good ideas, bad ideas, disagreements, and excitement. It is easy to write a song or come up
                    with an idea and want to keep it sheltered away so that it is not changed or tainted. However,
                    the music of Ocean Son is a testament that sharing those personal ideas and collaborating with
                    others can propel creative projects forward in new and exciting ways. I hope you can hear that
                    as you listen to a few of the tracks that I've produced with this group.

                    The name Ocean Son is quite literally my name. Dylan in Welsh translates to "son of the sea",
                    so Ocean Son is just a play on the translation of my name. While it is based on my name, I 
                    can't emphasize enough how none of these songs would be possible without the team that helped
                    me produce, rearrange, record, mix, and master these tracks. Because I know the value of 
                    working with other musicians and producers, I want to use this site and music library as a 
                    way of reaching out to others that have their own projects they have stuck in "creative limbo."
                    You know what I'm talking about, those songs that you wrote years ago that you haven't been 
                    willing to let go of but haven't been able to capture them how you like in a full production. 
                    Consider working with Ocean Son, we'd love to take your track to the next level. We can help
                    write awesome chord progressions, satisfying melodic guitar licks and leads, and creative beats.
                    With years of experience in song arrangement, music production, mixing and mastering, and overall
                    sound engineering, you will not regret collaborating with Ocean Son on your next big single. If you
                    are interested in collaborating with me, interested in using my music for a project or having me write
                    for your creative project, or just need a keyboard player/vocalist, please reach out!
