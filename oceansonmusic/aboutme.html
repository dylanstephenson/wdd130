                    <strong>About Me</strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Ocean Son project started out as a place where me, my brother - Beau Stephenson, 
                    friend and songwriter Chris Bennion, producer Carson Beck, and other talents would provide 
                    ideas and feedback on songs that I had written. Through the process of producing my first few songs 
                    in this way, I realized that Ocean Son was much bigger than myself and my own ideas. The songs I wrote
                    became a place where a variety of musical artists could work together while I learned 
                    from their experience and expertise. The weeks spent on No More, Heartbeat, Falling Apart, and other 
                    soon-to-be-released singles helped accelerate my growth as a songwriter and producer far more than any 
                    learning course I had previously participated in. Many songwriters I know write a song or come up with 
                    an idea and want to keep it sheltered away so that their creative vision isn't changed or tainted.  
                    The music of Ocean Son proves that sharing those personal ideas and collaborating with others can propel 
                    creative projects forward in new and exciting ways.

                    The name Ocean Son has a simple story. My name - Dylan - in Welsh translates to "son of the sea."
                    Ocean Son is just a variation of that translation. While it is based on my name, I 
                    can't emphasize enough how none of these songs would be possible without the team that helps
                    me produce, rearrange, record, mix, and master these tracks. I know the value of working with other 
                    musicians and producers and I want to use this site as a way of reaching out to other talented groups 
                    that have their own music projects they'd like to collaborate on. If this is you, consider working with 
                    Ocean Son. We'd love to take your ideas, your song, your production to the next level. Between me,
                    Beau, Chris, Carson, and other talents we employ, you'll find decades of piano, guitar, bass, drums, vocal,
                    writing, producing, mixing, and even mastering experience. Not only do we provide talent, but we always
                    have a great time collaborating on songs. I'm looking forward to working with you!
