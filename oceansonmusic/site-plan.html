      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is for sharing both performances I've done and music I've produced under my band name, "Ocean Son."
        This would be helpful for auditions for talent shows, musicals, networking with other producers, and sharing music with brands for commercial purposes.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My main audience would be those agents looking for talent for whatever production they are working on.
        It would also be for music supervisors in charge of finding music for commercial, short film, TV, etc.

      <p>
        People will want to come to my site because they will be interested in my musical talents for whatever projects they are working on. The first thing they should see on the site is a very basic bio, with a couple links to my most popular and well-produced tracks on the most popular music streaming services. This page should work kind of like a cover letter for a resume where it shows a little bit about me, a snapshot of my skills and previous work experience, and some references to projects that I have worked on. 

        I was originally going to have a mini bio next to my picture, but I decided to change what I'm doing to better fit the 
        requirements for the class. To make sure I have 150-200 words on this page, I will add a button by each of my songs 
        where someone can click to learn more about what the song's about and some of the process of making the song. The song summaries are
        as follows:

        No More - No More is the first song I wrote and fully produced through Ocean Son. A few months after going through a difficult breakup, I had the realization that I was happier, healthier, and more confident than I had been during the relationship which lead to me writing this song. I finished the song after meeting my now wife, Ashlie. She inspired the "She's everything" moment at the beginning and end of the song.
        Heartbeat - I wrote Heartbeat a few months after my wife and I got married. I started feeling a lot of pressure and anxiety knowing that all of my life choices would start directly affecting her. The Peter Gabriel-esque chord progression and the somber melody capture that feeling of worry and anxiety. The tonal shift in the chorus gives the feeling that even though hearing my wife's heartbeat makes me feel that pressure, having her with me is worth it.
        Fallin' Apart - Fallin' Apart was not only co-produced but also co-written alongside my brother, Beau Stephenson. We wanted to write something a little more funky than any of our previous songs. Fallin' Apart is not meant to have a deep message or poetic lyrics. Our goal writing this song was to find a good groove between the piano, bass, guitar, and drums. Syncopating the vocals along with all of the other elements makes this song incredibly catchy and fun to listen to every time.

      <h3>Music Library</h3>
      <p>
        The main page will have a few links to some of my bigger projects, but this page will have links to all the tracks that I’ve made. If possible, I’d like to list my song links in categories/playlists such as Acoustic Instrumental, Pop instrumental, Micro songs, LoFi, etc. I already have the songs listed on music streaming sites and my music portfolio on disco.ac, so these would just be links to external sites. 

All the music belongs to me and the Publisher I work with, ATRIO, so any interest in using the songs will be directed to my brother, Beau Stephenson, who handles any clients who want to use songs in the ATRIO library. Clients can speak with me directly for creating new projects or collaborating on already existing projects that they have. I can provide this brief explanation on the music library page and update the contact page with ATRIO’s contact if they are interested in those songs specifically. 

This music page will also link to my Instagram and TikTok accounts where I put songwriting ideas, news on upcoming projects and collaborations, and performances of some of my favorite songs.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Jumping from the mini-bio on the main page to the next page, this is where people will go to get a more thorough bio from me that covers what I’m about, what skills I have in musicianship, songwriting, vocals, and music production, and some of my work history. Below the bio should be a place where they can contact me directly. 

	The full Bio can look something like this. “Ocean Son, artistically lead by me, Dylan Stephenson, is a songwriting/music production project with a focus on fun, exciting original music enhanced through collaboration. I have collaborated with several artists including Coral Bones, Beau Stephenson, Ryan Innes, Carson Beck, KARA, and others. I’ve had full music productions that I’ve done entirely on my own only needing help with mixing and mastering the track, and I’ve co-produced tracks on songs that I’ve written. I produce primarily in Logic Studios. My strengths include Pop, rock, jazz, alternative, and indie. If you’re interested in having me play on your track, doing some vocal work, or you need songwriting/arranging/producing help, then let’s get in touch! My information is provided below. Looking forward to work with you!”
