            <h2>RiverRafting Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div id="question-box">
            <h3 class="group-1">What is so great about whitewater rafting?</h3>
            <p class="group-p1">Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day 
                    on the river. Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under 
                    a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets 
                    to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination 
                    of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to 
                    hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company 
                    by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps 
                    like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the 
                    dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your 
                    guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>
            <h3 class="group-2">Is this a good trip for kids?</h3>
            <p class="group-p2">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over 
                    the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their 
                    children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be 
                    bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of 
                    any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you 
                    never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things 
                    very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river 
                    guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even 
                    true!</p>
            <h3 class="group-3">Is whitewater rafting safe?</h3>                
            <p class="group-p3">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure 
                    your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 
                    3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur 
                    on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal 
                    flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide 
                    will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you 
                    should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>
