        <p>Hello everyone! Glad to be a part of this class with all of you. I am currently married and living in Murray UT with my wife Ashlie. I have been a member of the church my whole life and served my mission in the West Virigina Charleston mission.</p>
        <p>My interests revolve mainly arround music. I play the piano and guitar and sing, and I love to write and produce music. I've released a couple songs on spotify and it is always a happy, fulfilling endeavor releasing new music. I also love pickleball, tennis, hiking, video games, and cooking.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working on the the Software Development BS through Pathway Worldwide and I feel incredibly blessed to be a part of the program. Being able to work full time while also pursuing education online is such a blessing. I've always had an affinity to computers and I love making things, regardless if it's a new song or a new recipe. I'm excited to translate this skill to coding.</p>
        <p>I work full time as a tech support rep so I am very familiar with troubleshooting and QA. I have used HTML a lot already in writing instructional articles for my company's website. I'm excited to add CSS and more advanced HTML skills to my toolset. Thanks for looking at my web page.</p>
